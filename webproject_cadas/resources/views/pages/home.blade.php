                <b><br>FAMELO</b> examines how family migration impacts children’s socio-psychological development.
                Using a model that blends migration and child development perspectives, the study explores how migration
                affects left-behind children’s social skills and psychological well-being, and how different environments
                influence their outcomes. The goal is to help families adapt and guide policymakers in supporting mental
                health and addressing issues like depression, anxiety, aggression, and substance use.

            We initially designed the study to span five years (2015-2020), but it was delayed until 2022 due to the
            COVID-19 pandemic. In Wave 1, we began data collection on July 5, 2017, and completed it on July 9, 2018.
            Similarly, in Wave 2, we started data collection on April 8, 2021, and completed it on December 23, 2021.

            {{-- We build on previous research by the 10/66 Dementia Research Group
            <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i> that indicates a remarkably high dementia
            prevalence of 10-12% among metro-dwelling adults aged 65+ in Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic and Cuba, whose
            similar histories but richly varying societal structures over the past century offer great promise for better
            understanding AD/ADRD. These Hispanic Caribbean sites are also the origin of the vast majority of Caribbean
            immigrants to the U.S., and we will also compare experiences in sending countries with experiences among U.S.
            immigrants. Our surveys are designed for cross-harmonization with both past 10/66 surveys as well as the global
            network of recent surveys using the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol <i class="fa fa-external-link"

            We covered 12 Village Development Committees and one Municipality in Western Chitwan, Nepal. Out of the total
            wards present in the study area, we randomly selected 54 sample sub-wards. Based on a listing of households,
            these 54 wards were divided into 119 sub-wards, with approximately 250 households in each sub-ward. From this
            listing and household count, we chose 54 sub-wards for our study. In Wave 1, we initially selected a sample of
            2268 households (42 households per sub-ward). Later, to increase the number of children aged 14 to 17 years, we
            sampled an additional 378 households (7 households in each of the 54 sub-wards). In total, we sampled 2646
            households for the Wave 1 survey.
