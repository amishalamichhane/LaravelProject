                <b><br>FAMELO</b> examines how family migration impacts children’s socio-psychological development.
                Using a model that blends migration and child development perspectives, the study explores how migration
                affects left-behind children’s social skills and psychological well-being, and how different environments
                influence their outcomes. The goal is to help families adapt and guide policymakers in supporting mental
                health and addressing issues like depression, anxiety, aggression, and substance use.

            We initially designed the study to span five years (2015-2020), but it was delayed until 2022 due to the
            COVID-19 pandemic. In Wave 1, we began data collection on July 5, 2017, and completed it on July 9, 2018.
            Similarly, in Wave 2, we started data collection on April 8, 2021, and completed it on December 23, 2021.

            We covered 12 Village Development Committees and one Municipality in Western Chitwan, Nepal. Out of the total
            wards present in the study area, we randomly selected 54 sample sub-wards. Based on a listing of households,
            these 54 wards were divided into 119 sub-wards, with approximately 250 households in each sub-ward. From this
            listing and household count, we chose 54 sub-wards for our study. In Wave 1, we initially selected a sample of
            2268 households (42 households per sub-ward). Later, to increase the number of children aged 14 to 17 years, we
            sampled an additional 378 households (7 households in each of the 54 sub-wards). In total, we sampled 2646
            households for the Wave 1 survey.

                <h3>Project Background </h3>
                <p>This project explores how family migration impacts the social and emotional development of left-behind
                    children,
                    focusing on both the costs and benefits. While migration may bring financial resources that can benefit
                    children, it often disrupts family dynamics, affecting their psychological well-being and social
                    competence.
                    Research on these children, especially in specific sending communities, is limited, and this study aims
                    to
                    fill
                    that gap.
                </p>
                <h3>Purpose of Data Collection </h3>
                <p>
                    Focusing on children in Nepal, where labor migration is common, the project examines how migration
                    affects
                    family relationships, caregiving, and household resources. The findings aim to guide policymakers in
                    addressing
                    challenges like depression, anxiety, and behavioral issues among left-behind children.

                <h3>Scope </h3>
                <p>
                    Data was collected in three waves (2017, 2020, and 2023) from children and their caregivers in Nepal's
                    Western
                    Chitwan Valley. This study includes interviews with fathers to assess migration's long-term effects on
                    children's expectations as they grow. The goal is to provide insights that can inform better policies
                    around
                    parent-child separation and protect children's rights.
