            Guided by an innovative conceptual model incorporating perspectives from the migration and child development
            literatures, this project examines multiple child- and environment-level mechanisms through which the migration
            of family members is associated with left-behind children's social competence and psychological adjustment
            problems. New knowledge about migration's costs and benefits can assist families in settings with a high
            prevalence of labor migration as they adapt to the changes that migration brings to family members'
            relationships, caregiving, and households' resources. This research can also help policy makers anticipate the
            challenges that migration poses to children's mental health and positive adjustment, and inform policies and
            interventions aimed at supporting left-behind family members and reducing problems such as depression, anxiety,
            aggression, rule-breaking, and substance use.
