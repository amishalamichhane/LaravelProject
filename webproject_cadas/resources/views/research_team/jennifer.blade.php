            I am the Hoffman Professor of Sociology and Demography at The Pennsylvania State University. As the Program
            Director for the FAMELO project, I coordinate activities across all research sites. As the PI for Project 2, I
            lead research on children's educational aspirations and trajectories as family members migrate from the
            household or return. You can learn more about me <a href="https://pop.psu.edu/directory/1277/jeg115">here</a>.
