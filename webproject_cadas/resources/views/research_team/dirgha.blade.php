            Dr. Ghimire studies social change, developmental idealism, family and demography, population and environment
            dynamics. His research within family and demography revolves around three sub areas- marriage (marital
            arrangement, marital relationship and relationship dynamics), childbearing (timing of first birth), and
            fertility limitation (contraceptive use). In addition, he also studies reproductive health, HIV/AIDS and mental
            health and well-being. Another major area of Dr. Ghimireâ€™s research focuses on understanding of the interplay
            between population and environmental processes (reciprocal impacts of population processes on land use and
            terrestrial biodiversity, and environmental degradation on childbearing, contraceptive use, individual mobility,
            household energy use). More recently his work has focused on ideational aspects of these substantive areas.
